    "summary": "The majority voted against a [motion](https://www.openaustralia.org.au/senate/?id=2019-07-24.195.1) introduced by Queensland Senator [Larissa Waters](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/senate/queensland/larissa_waters) (Greens), which means it failed.\r\n\r\n### Motion text\r\n\r\n> *That the Senate—*\r\n>\r\n> *(a) notes that:*\r\n>\r\n>> *(i) on 17 July 2019, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority released a Position Statement on Climate Change, which stated: 'climate change is the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef. Only the strongest and fastest possible actions to decrease global greenhouse gas emissions will reduce the risks and limit the impacts of climate change on the Reef'... 'If we are to secure a future for the Great Barrier Reef and coral reef ecosystems globally, there is an urgent and critical need to accelerate actions to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. This must happen in parallel to taking actions to build the Reef's resilience',*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(ii) in an address to the British Parliament on 9 July 2019, Sir David Attenborough criticised Australia for not taking the risks of climate change seriously, and imperilling the Great Barrier Reef,*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(iii) at its meeting in 2015, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee gave the Australian Government five years to address the state of the Great Barrier Reef before it re-considered whether to include it on the World Heritage In Danger list—the Australian Government is due to submit a report addressing the protection of the Reef's Outstanding Universal Value to avert an In Danger listing by 1 December 2019,*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(iv) scientific reports confirm that approximately half of the shallow water coral of the Great Barrier Reef has been lost since 2016 due to successive coral bleaching incidents,*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(v) the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators has signed a Reef Climate Declaration that acknowledges climate change as \"the single biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef\" and states that \"Australia must join the rest of the world to rapidly phase out coal and other fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy\",*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(vi) the Great Barrier Reef supports approximately 64,000 jobs and generates $6 billion for the Australian economy annually,*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(vii) the science and the economics are clear that these jobs are at risk if strong action is not taken immediately to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature rises to 1.5°C, and*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(viii) fossil fuel companies have donated nearly $5 million to the Liberals, The Nationals and Labor parties over the past four years; and*\r\n>\r\n> *(b) calls on the Federal Government to:*\r\n>\r\n>> *(i) affirm the advice of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority that climate change is the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef,*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(ii) direct Mr Warren Entsch, Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef, to prioritise actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions,*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(iii) implement a climate policy that accelerates actions to limit global warming to 1.5°C to protect the Great Barrier Reef,*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(iv) take all action necessary to properly protect the Great Barrier Reef and avoid the UNESCO World Heritage Committee needing to place the Great Barrier Reef on the World Heritage In Danger list,*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(v) revoke all federal approvals for the Adani Carmichael mine and not approve any new coal in Australia, and*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(vi) develop a clear plan to move towards 100% clean energy, including a plan for a just transition for Australia's regional workforces affected by climate change so that regional economies can thrive and workers are protected, and ban corporate donations to political parties from the fossil fuel industry, an industry which financially benefits from this Government's lack of action on climate change.*",
